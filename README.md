This webpage will be the place where the information of all cars in history will be displayed, I cant post all the data so my intention is to make a feauture that will allow people to post in the web.
The principal reason of this proyect is to practise and explore more about web developing so im sure therell be innecesary things.

My fisrt roadmap would be:

1-Funcional API and h2 database
2- FrontEnd and connect it
3-MiddleWare and some extras
